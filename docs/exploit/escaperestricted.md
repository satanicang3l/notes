1. Most of the times very similar to upgrade interactive shell.
2. Usually just need to try python way of upgrading:\
   `python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`
3. Check what is on PATH, `echo $PATH`. If the path is in your current folder, just `ls foldername` (no need to use `/`). Check GTFObin and see if you can shell with any of the file inside.
